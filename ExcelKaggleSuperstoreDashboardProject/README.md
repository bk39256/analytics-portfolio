The Kaggle Superstore Sales Dashboard project that I worked on involved taking a publicly available Kaggle dataset tracking a large store's products, sales, etc. and transforming that data into a dashboard with visualized charts, KPIs, and trends. Although I would like more experience in data aggregation, this self-led project was a great way for me to tinker with Excel and make my very first Excel dashboard.
